# MapComputerView

This repository contains programs for visualizing temperature maps by year and calculating the differences between them. The maps are generated based on temperature data, allowing for easy comparison between different years. We used this idea for a presentation on V SCIENTIF which was published on the following link: https://ifpr.edu.br/cascavel/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2024/12/Anais-do-V-Scientif-1.pdf PAGE 137.

## Maps Overview

- **mapa-year**: Represents the temperature map for a specific year (e.g., mapa-1970, mapa-1990).
  
- **diferenca9070**: Represents the difference in temperature between two years (1990 - 1970). Positive values indicate warming, while negative values indicate cooling.
