# MapComputerView
This project uses computer view to build images based on maps of heat on Brazil.
The idea here is to analise the difference between years of temperatures on Brazil
we can first analise based on the difference maps that the change on temperatures
is constant, but nowadays started to be in the hole contry, not only in the regions
it mostly happened.
We used the maps of INMET and the code are not only for Brazilian maps, it can interprete
the maps you want, it only needs to be padronized (same size, positions, colors pattern etc)
